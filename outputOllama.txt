First, I need to identify the coefficients of the quadratic equation in standard form. The given equation is \(2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0\), so the coefficients are \(a = 2\), \(b = 5\), and \(c = 3\).

Next, I will calculate the discriminant using the formula \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\). Plugging in the values, I get \(\Delta = 5^2 - 4(2)(3) = 25 - 24 = 1\).

Since the discriminant is positive and a perfect square, there are two rational solutions. 

I will then apply the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}\). Substituting the values, I get:
\[ x = \frac{-5 \pm 1}{4} \]

This results in two solutions: 
- For the positive sign: \(\frac{-5 + 1}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1\)
- For the negative sign: \(\frac{-5 - 1}{4} = \frac{-6}{4} = -1.5\) or \(-\frac{3}{2}\)

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are \(x = -1\) and \(x = -\frac{3}{2}\).

To solve the quadratic equation:

\[ 2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0 \]

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients**

The equation is in the standard form of a quadratic equation:

\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

Here:
- \( a = 2 \)
- \( b = 5 \)
- \( c = 3 \)

**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant**

The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) helps determine the nature of the roots. It is calculated as:

\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \Delta = (5)^2 - 4(2)(3) = 25 - 24 = 1 \]

**Step 3: Determine the nature of the roots**

Since the discriminant is positive and a perfect square (\(\Delta = 1\)), there are two distinct real rational roots.

**Step 4: Apply the quadratic formula**

The quadratic formula is:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{2(2)} = \frac{-5 \pm 1}{4} \]

**Step 5: Calculate both solutions**

- For the positive sign (\(+\)):

\[ x_1 = \frac{-5 + 1}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1 \]

- For the negative sign (\(-\)):

\[ x_2 = \frac{-5 - 1}{4} = \frac{-6}{4} = -\frac{3}{2} \]

**Final Solutions:**

\[ x = -1 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -\frac{3}{2} \]

So, the solutions to the equation \( 2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0 \) are:

\[ \boxed{-1 \quad \text{and} \quad -\frac{3}{2}} \]
